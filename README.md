# hacknroll19

Current Bugs:

1. UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: 400: Bad Request: message text is empty (Appears when user interacts with bot, does not affect performance at all)

2. 'Yes' & 'No' inline buttons unable to display (after location selection)

3. 'Fault Location' selector does not go away unless the user leaves the bot's page

4. If user is prompted to send photo but sends anything else, bot crashes

To-do Functionality:

1. Proper way to initialize bot (eg: /start or /report), right now bot just responds to any input and 'wakes up' ready to file a report

2. Data verification (proper matric numbers etc)

3. Ability to edit report (right now any mistake made requires the user to re-do the report from the start)

4. Ability for the user to check the status of his current reports (to see what stage of the repair-work has been completed)
